# lua_mods

##UPDATE
Sadly, **this project is currently on hold** *because I have so much homework to do*. Any further updates will happen completely sporadically, and in a non-organized manner (possibly not even here). **Check back** *when I've grown up, or alternatively* **in a few years***, whichever happens first*.

Lua scripts meant to provide a sort of "API" for modding certain games to be played on scriptable emulators (and mods created using it)
